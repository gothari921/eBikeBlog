## Day 0
<div class="day-card">
I opened the box and examined the contents. I logged everything in my phone and figured out what we would need to buy. The box contained the rim with the hub motor, the battery, and a number of tools to assist us. It seems like easy work; all we would have to do is load up the instructions and buy the rim tape and tube to attach the tire.
