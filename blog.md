## Day 0
I opened the box and examined the contents. I logged everything in my phone and figured out what we would need to buy. The box contained the rim with the hub motor, the battery, and a number of tools to assist us. It seems like easy work; all we would have to do is load up the instructions and buy the rim tape and tube to attach the tire.

## Day 1
Today was much harder than what I expected it to be. For starters, I had problems with getting the bike upside down to work on it. After working with my dad, we set up an impromptu table, using an old TV stand and some pieces of wood from the bed frame we weren‚Äôt using. This workbench, as well as some videos on how to remove the tire, helped us achieve the first step, which was problematic enough.  

Next, I set out on trying to remove the freewheel off the bike by myself. It was much harder than I thought. The instruction manual switched up the two attachments and what to use, which added even more confusion to my feeble brain who didn‚Äôt even know what a freewheel was. After even more research, I started to understand what to do and what pieces to use. Unfortunately, contrary to the videos, removing the freewheel is a two-person process, and our freewheel seemed adamant on being stuck to the old rim.  

After taking it to REI, they managed to loosen the nut holding everything in place. And after a quick stop at Sports Basement to buy the tube and rim tape, I was able to loosen the freewheel off of the old rim. But now a new problem occurred, one so big it might result in the end of this project. There is no way for the freewheel to get onto the new rim. The connectors look nothing like the old rim, and contain studs instead of threads. But today has been problematic enough; it looks like a problem for tomorrow me.

## Day 2
Tomorrow me here, and it looks like there is hope for me yet. The rim they supplied us with was designed for cassette gears, while ours were freewheel. However, cassette gears can cost as little as $15, which means all we have to do to fix our major problem is buy a set of cassette gears.  

In the meantime, I removed the tire from the old wheel and attached it onto the new rim. This was a big milestone, and it meant that we were only waiting on the cassette to get our bike back on its own two wheels. During this holdup, we can start the process of wiring up the bike, starting with the PAS Sensor.

## Day 3
Today was mostly a prep day. I ordered a set of cassette gears from Amazon, which should solve the compatibility issue we encountered earlier. With that on the way, I reviewed what would come next: attaching the cassette, removing the crank, and setting up the PAS (pedal assist sensor). Everything is starting to come together, but there‚Äôs still plenty left to do once the parts arrive.

---

## Day 4
The cassette gears haven‚Äôt arrived yet, so I turned my attention to the crank. I successfully removed it and picked up a socket wrench set to help with some of the upcoming installations. While looking into how to attach the PAS sensor, I discovered a new method that bypasses the need to remove the bottom bracket entirely‚Äîa huge time saver. Once the cassette gears are in place and the rear wheel is fully installed, we can finally start tackling the wiring.

---

## Day 5
The PAS sensor is now installed! It was one of the more intricate parts, but the new attachment method worked out smoothly. With that checked off the list, the focus now shifts to getting the cassette gears on and starting the wiring process. That‚Äôll be the next big milestone once the rear wheel is fully secure.

---

## Day 6
A lot came together today. The cassette gears were finally attached, and both the rear and front wheels are now on the bike. I also got the brakes installed, which felt like a major step forward. The core of the bike is nearly complete. Next up: installing the throttle and display, mounting the battery and its casing, and finally wiring everything together.

---

## Day 7
After a full week of work, the bike is finally complete! I had to temporarily remove the brakes and gear shifters from the handlebars to make room for all the new components, but I‚Äôve successfully finished wiring everything up. At first, nothing seemed to power on after connecting the battery, which was frustrating. But after troubleshooting‚Äîtightening connections and fully charging the battery‚Äîthe bike finally came to life. It's an absolute joy to ride, and I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve accomplished.
